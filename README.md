# YouTube Append Video Time in URL

## Description

This extension appends the `time of the video in seconds` tick by tick in the URL of the current video that are playing (like the share link that YouTube generates with the time of the video).

That way you `don't loss the progress of the videos` you are watching and you can easily save the video in your `Bookmarks` where you paused the video.

Using `History API`, the video will save the time of video in the History of Chrome when you close the window by mistake for example.

## How to use it

-   Go to `Chrome menu` -> `More tools` > `Extensions`.
-   Enable `Developer mode` in the top right of the screen.
-   Click in the `Load unpacked` button.
-   Select this folder in your file dialog of your system.
